Only working solution is 
installing exFAT/NTFS by Paragon software from Play Store here & 
installing total commander file manager here 
give both permissions. 
Open exFAT app, mount ur usb drive, wait 15 seconds & then proceed. 
Then click open, total commander would open. 
Find ur usb & copy paste or rename whatever u want. Credit to one YouTuber & developers of these apps
